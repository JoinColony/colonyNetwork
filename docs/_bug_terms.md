## Eligibility and Participation Requirements

To participate in this bug bounty you must:

* Not be employed by Colony, a family member of a person employed by Colony, or a contractor of Colony.
* Not be in violation of any national state, or local law or regulation with respect to any activities directly or indirectly related to the Bug Bounty Program

To qualify for a bounty you must:
* Be the first to report a specific vulnerability
* Report a vulnerability through the process outlined in the [Rules and Scope](link)
* Disclose the vulnerability responsibly and directly to Colony. Disclosure to other third parties before or during bug review will invalidate the submission
* Not seek or leverage the vulnerability for additional or external bounties or rewards

### Good Faith Participation
All participants in the Bug Bounty Program must act in good faith when investigating vulnerabilities. "Good Faith" means:

* Play by the Rules -- Abide by the terms and conditions specified herein. If you have any questions or concerns about the terms and conditions, please reach out directly to the Colony team about it
* Don't be a jerk. You should never illegally or in bad faith leverage the existence of a vulnerability or access to sensitive or confidential information, such as making extortionate demands or ransom requests or trying to shake us down. In other words, if you find a vulnerability, report it to us with no conditions attached
* Work for Good --  You should never leave a system or users in a more vulnerable state than when you found them. This means that you should not engage in testing or related activities that degrades, damages, or destroys information within our systems, or that may impact our users, such as denial of service, social engineering, or spam

Failure to act in good faith will result in immediate disqualification from the Bug Bounty Program and ineligibility for receiving any benefit of the Bug Bounty Program

## Service Level Agreement

After a vulnerability has been submitted either as an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork/issues) or as an email to `security@colony.io`, the Colony team will evaluate and determine if the vulnerability is eligible for a bounty within 3 days.

Accepted bounties will be graded and assigned a severity according to the team's assesment within 7 days, or a total of 10 days from first submission.

Once the severity and bounty is decided, the Colony team will begin work on patching the bug. In this case, a PR will be opened that references the issue of original report. This PR may request more information from the submitter of the bug, and may accept input from external developers for fixing. Participation in resolving a vulnerability is welcome but not required to receive a bounty.

When the PR closing the referenced issue is merged to the `/develop` branch (and, in the case of a live mainnet deployment, an upgrade has been successfully deployed), the issue will be considered "resolved" and payment can take place.

Payment will be disbursed as DAI through the Gitcoin platform to the account which submitted the bounty report, unless otherwise requested by the submitter. Payment will take place as soon as possible following the report's resolution, but may take up to 30 days to process.

You must comply with all applicable laws in connection with your participation in this program. You are also responsible for any applicable taxes associated with any reward you receive.
