# Motions & Disputes Extension (`VotingReputation`)

This extension allows any member of your colony to propose a Motion to take an Action that will pass after a security delay unless somebody Objects. This applies to all Actions, such as creating an expenditure, managing funds, or managing teams.

_This is a Colony Extension which conforms to the extension interface found [here](icolonyextension.md)._
