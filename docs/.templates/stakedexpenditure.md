# Staked Expenditure (`StakedExpenditure`)

This extension allows users without the Administration permission to create
expenditures by posting a small stake. If the expenditure is refined and
finalized without issue, then the stake is returned. If for whatever reason
the creator is found to have acted inapproriately, they run the risk of losing
their stake.

_This is a Colony Extension which conforms to the extension interface found [here](icolonyextension.md)._
