# Funding Queue (`FundingQueue`)

Funding Queues are a core mechanic described in the Colony whitepaper,
allowing for teams to allocate resources in a distributed manner. Members of
a colony can make and back funding proposals, requesting that some number of tokens be
transferred between domains. The more reputation backing a proposal, the more
quickly the proposal is fulfilled, up to a maximum of half of the source domain's
assets per week. By creating and bacing funding proposals throughout the colony,
a steady flow of resources from the root through the domains can be achieved.
