# Whitelist Extension (`Whitelist`)

Alongside the Coin Machine Extension, a colony may use the Whitelist extension to filter wallet addresses allowed to take part in a token sale on Coin Machine.

See [here](https://colony.gitbook.io/colony/extensions/whitelist) for more information.

_This is a Colony Extension which conforms to the extension interface found [here](icolonyextension.md)._
