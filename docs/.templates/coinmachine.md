# Coin Machine Extension (`CoinMachine`)

Coin Machine is a mechanism to sell tokens within a colony, simplifying the process for all participants involved. It introduces the functionality to sell limited amounts of tokens in fixed-price batches, adjusting prices up or down in between sale periods based on recent demand. Coin Machine sacrifices continual availability and real-time price adjustment for the simplicity of fixed price and fixed supply, thereby also sidestepping the challenges of price manipulation, volatility, and front-running.
