# Token Supplier (`TokenSupplier`)

A simple extension which allows a colony to automatically manage the
token supply. A colony can configure a maximum supply and a rate of issuance,
at which point anyone can continually mint tokens and have them sent
to the colony.

_This is a Colony Extension which conforms to the extension interface found [here](icolonyextension.md)._
