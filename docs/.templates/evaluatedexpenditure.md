# Evaluated Expenditure (`EvaluatedExpenditure`)

Evaluated Expenditures is a simple extension which allows the owner of an expenditure
to update the payout modifiers after the expenditure is locked, effectively enabling
the "evaluation" functionality we initially described as a part of the Tasks flow.
Without this extension, payout modifiers can only be set by the Arbitration permission
once the expenditure is locked, making it tedious to implement evaluation workflows.

_This is a Colony Extension which conforms to the extension interface found [here](icolonyextension.md)._
