**Parameters**

|Name|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|u|uint256[26]|A `uint256[27]` array. The elements of this array, in order are: * 1. The current round of the hash being responded on behalf of * 2. The current index in the round of the hash being responded on behalf of * 3. The branchMask of the proof that the reputation is in the reputation state tree for the reputation with the disputed change * 4. The number of nodes in the last reputation state that both submitted hashes agree on * 5. The branchMask of the proof that the last reputation state the submitted hashes agreed on is in this submitted hash's justification tree * 6. The number of nodes this hash considers to be present in the first reputation state the two hashes in this challenge disagree on * 7. The branchMask of the proof that reputation root hash of the first reputation state the two hashes in this challenge disagree on is in this submitted hash's justification tree * 8. The index of the log entry that the update in question was implied by. Each log entry can imply multiple reputation updates, and so we expect the clients to pass      the log entry index corresponding to the update to avoid us having to iterate over the log. * 9. A dummy variable that should be set to 0. If nonzero, transaction will still work but be slightly more expensive. For an explanation of why this is present, look at the corresponding solidity code. * 10. Origin skill reputation branch mask. Nonzero for child reputation updates. * 11. The amount of reputation that the entry in the tree under dispute has in the agree state * 12. The UID that the entry in the tree under dispute has in the agree state * 13. The amount of reputation that the entry in the tree under dispute has in the disagree state * 14. The UID that the entry in the tree under dispute has in the disagree state * 15. The amount of reputation that the user's origin reputation entry in the tree has in the state being disputed * 16. The UID that the user's origin reputation entry in the tree has in the state being disputed * 17. The branchMask of the proof that the child reputation for the user being updated is in the agree state * 18. The amount of reputation that the child reputation for the user being updated is in the agree state * 19. The UID of the child reputation for the user being updated in the agree state * 20. A dummy variable that should be set to 0. If nonzero, transaction will still work but be slightly more expensive. For an explanation of why this is present, look at the corresponding solidity code. * 21. The branchMask of the proof that the reputation adjacent to the new reputation being inserted is in the agree state * 22. The amount of reputation that the reputation adjacent to a new reputation being inserted has in the agree state * 23. The UID of the reputation adjacent to the new reputation being inserted * 24. A dummy variable that should be set to 0. If nonzero, transaction will still work but be slightly more expensive. For an explanation of why this is present, look at the corresponding solidity code. * 25. The value of the reputation that would be origin-adjacent that proves that the origin reputation does not exist in the tree * 26. The value of the reputation that would be child-adjacent that proves that the child reputation does not exist in the tree
|b32|bytes32[7]|A `bytes32[8]` array. The elements of this array, in order are: * 1. The colony address in the key of the reputation being changed that the disagreement is over. * 2. The skillid in the key of the reputation being changed that the disagreement is over. * 3. The user address in the key of the reputation being changed that the disagreement is over. * 4. The keccak256 hash of the key of the reputation being changed that the disagreement is over. * 5. The keccak256 hash of the key for a reputation already in the tree adjacent to the new reputation being inserted, if required. * 6.

|disagreeStateSiblings|bytes32[]|The siblings of the Merkle proof that the first reputation state the submitted hashes disagreed on is in this submitted hash's justification tree
|userOriginReputationSiblings|bytes32[]|Nonzero for child updates only. The siblings of the Merkle proof of the user's origin skill reputation added to the reputation tree in the last reputation state the submitted hashes agree on
|childReputationSiblings|bytes32[]|Nonzero for child updates of a colony-wide global skill. The siblings of the Merkle proof of the child skill reputation of the user in the same skill this global update is for

### `rewardStakersWithReputation`
