Contracts for running the Colony Network as defined in the [Colony White Paper](https://colony.io/whitepaper.pdf)

## Install
```
git clone https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork.git
cd colonyNetwork
yarn
git submodule update --init
```

## Contracts
The contract upgradability is using the EtherRouter pattern, see [Upgrades to the Colony Network](https://joincolony.github.io/colonynetwork/docs-upgrades-to-the-colony-network/) in the documentation for implementation details.

The `math`, `erc20`, `auth`, `roles` and a significant part of the `token` contract have been reused from the [Dappsys library](https://github.com/dapphub/dappsys-monolithic).
