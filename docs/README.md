# The Colony Network

Contracts for running the Colony Network as defined in the [Colony White Paper](https://colony.io/whitepaper.pdf)

## Bug Bounty Program
Colony is offering substantial rewards to external developers who report bugs and flaws in the colonyNetwork contracts.

See the [Bug Bounty program overview](./_bug_rules.md) for more information about bounties, rules, and terms.

## Install
```
git clone https://github.com/JoinColony/colonyNetwork.git
cd colonyNetwork
yarn
git submodule update --init
yarn run provision:token:contracts
```

## Contracts
The contract upgradability is using the EtherRouter pattern, see [the delegate proxy pattern](https://docs.colony.io/colonynetwork/docs-upgrade-design/) in the documentation for implementation details.

The `math`, `erc20`, `auth`, `roles` and a significant part of the `token` contract have been reused from the [Dappsys library](https://github.com/dapphub/dappsys-monolithic).

## Testing
To run all tests:
```
yarn run test:contracts
```
To run tests with code coverage using [solidity-coverage](https://github.com/sc-forks/solidity-coverage):
```
yarn run test:contracts:coverage
```
To lint contracts using [Solium](https://github.com/duaraghav8/Solium)
```
yarn run solium
```

To lint JS using `eslint` (this is also a pre-commit hook)
```
yarn run eslint
```
